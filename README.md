# ![](MainIcon.bmp) CASIO Pong
Yet another Pong clone, but this time... it's on a calculator... in *C*.

## Why?
Around last year I've upgrade my calculator's firmware to the one used by the
CASIO *fx-9860G* to get Natural Display.

But then I figured out I could write more than just simple CASIO BASIC programs
on it. Especially with how I can't quite plot pixels on the display exactly.

I got the SDK and started learning ANSI C. That is the first program I've made
so far... Because it was simple, and taught me some skills to hopefully write
more useful and more advanced programs.

## How do I get it?
You can download the G1A from [here](Releases/).

You'll need a CASIO fx-9860G or CASIO fx-9750G with the [firmware upgraded](https://blog.easoncxz.com/2012/05/flashing-the-fx-9750gii).

To transfer the G1A, you'll need the [FA-124 Link Software](https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/software/).

## How do I build it?
You'll have to somehow get your hands on the SDK. [Here](https://wiki.planet-casio.com/en/Fx-9860G_SDK) is a starting point.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is helpful if you want to contribute to this repository.
